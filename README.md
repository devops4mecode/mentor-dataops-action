# Example of DataOps Pipeline using Apache Ariflow

## What is Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows you to define complex data pipelines, which can be triggered by events, scheduled to run at specific times, or manually started and stopped. Airflow is highly configurable, allowing you to create workflows that involve many different tasks, each with its own dependencies and requirements.

Airflow workflows are defined using Python code, which allows for a high degree of customization and flexibility. Each workflow is represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which is a collection of tasks that are executed in a specific order. Tasks can be Python functions, scripts, or commands, and can be run on a variety of platforms, including local machines, servers, and cloud-based platforms.

Airflow provides a rich set of features that make it easy to manage complex data pipelines. These include support for backfilling, task retries, dynamic task generation, parallel execution, and more. It also provides a web interface for monitoring and managing workflows, as well as an API that allows for programmatic access to Airflow's features.

## File and GitHub Action

Here's a list of the folders and files required to run the example DataOps CI/CD GitAction workflow script that I provided earlier:

requirements.txt: A file containing a list of Python dependencies required by the code.
tests/: A folder containing Python files with test cases for the code.
Dockerfile: A Dockerfile that defines the environment and dependencies required to run the code in a Docker container.
dags/: A folder containing the Apache Airflow DAG files that define the data pipeline to be executed.
.github/workflows/: A folder containing the GitAction workflow YAML file that defines the CI/CD pipeline.
All of these files and folders should be located in the root directory of your Git repository. The requirements.txt, tests/, and dags/ folders should be specific to the code you're trying to test and deploy. The Dockerfile should define the specific environment and dependencies required by your code to run in a Docker container. Finally, the .github/workflows/ folder should contain the GitAction workflow YAML file that defines the CI/CD pipeline and should reference the appropriate files and folders required for testing and deployment.
